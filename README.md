Script simulating a git workflow to 1/ validate commands and options to use and 2/ be a reference of commands and options to use.
This repo hosts both the script (flowtest.sh) and the history it generates.
The simulated flow is similar to GitHub one: master is always potentially shippable, all work is done in branches, etc. See GitHub flow for more details.
See flowtest.sh for more details.
